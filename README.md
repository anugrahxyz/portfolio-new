# Personal Identity Platform (V3)

This is a Polywork-inspired Personal Operating System (V3) focused on a single person with multiple personas, projects, and ongoing reflective activities.

## Philosophy

- People inhabit multiple parallel roles with evolving identities
- Insight and proof are prioritized over titles or marketing
- The system is present-focused and reflective, not a resume or portfolio
- UI is calm, minimal, card-based, and notebook-like
- No social features, buzzwords, or skills lists

## Key Features

- Profile with name, tagline, "Now" section, and **Current Focus** card highlighting primary direction and active personas
- Personas as primary navigation acting as contextual filters
- Projects with status badges and current focal points
- Focus Timeline showing phases of focus linking personas and projects
- Learning Log capturing short, intention-driven reflections linked to personas and projects
- Identity Shifts reflecting evolution and growth in personas

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.
